                    <p>Stephan Winkelmann, Chairman and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini, commented: “Our business
                        continues to grow, and we can proudly confirm the achievement of truly remarkable targets once
                        again in 2022. These figures come in a very important year for the company, which is marking its
                        60th anniversary and entering the second phase of the Direzione Cor Tauri program: an
                        unparalleled investment plan that will guide our growth, lead to further improvements in our
                        financial performance, and boost the value of our brand and our company. We are ready to face
                        the many challenges and changes that await us in 2023 and we will keep pushing to the next
                        level. We have an opportunity to really focus on our next objectives, thanks in part to our
                        18-month’ waiting list, which means we can confidently contemplate our future targets. This is a
                        golden time for Lamborghini: we have made history even as we continue to pursue growth.”

                    <p>2022 was also a record-breaking year for deliveries. Lamborghini recorded its highest ever number
                        of vehicles delivered and sold more than 9,000 cars for the first time in its history. The signs
                        were extremely positive in all macro-regions, with distribution remaining even and consistent
                        with the Lamborghini strategy. Asia was at the forefront with a 14% increase, followed by
                        America with +10%, while EMEA was up by 7% on 2021. The United States remained in the top spot
                        overall (2721 cars delivered, up 10% on the previous year); followed by the Chinese Mainland,
                        Hong Kong & Macao (1018 cars delivered, up 9% on 2021); Germany (808 cars delivered, up 14% on
                        the previous year); the United Kingdom (650 cars delivered, up 15% on the previous year); and
                        Japan (546 cars delivered, up 22% on the previous year).
